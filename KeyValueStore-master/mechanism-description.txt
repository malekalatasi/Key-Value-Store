Choosing which shards each replica goes to
---------------------------------
When initially choosing which shard each replica will go under, a shard will be
created for the number of shards we want, then for each replica to add, they will
be added to the shard with the least number of replicas, in order to balance the
shards as much as possible.

Resharding
---------------------------------
The node which the administrator triggered the reshard will take upon the role as
a leader and do all the calculations to reshard, including re-allocating replicas
to shards, and moving keys to the correct replica. Then, this "leader" will send
the changes to all other nodes so it is propagated throughout the kvs.

Key to shard mapping
---------------------------------
The specified key is converted to a string, then the ascii values of each character
are summed together, and the modulus of that number by the number of shards yields
the shard that particular key should be a part of.
This is a very neutral hashing algorithm without the overhead of more feature-rich
algorithms such as MD5 which are more computationally intensive and will take
longer.
